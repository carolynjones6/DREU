title: Week 1

This week was my first week in Dr. Kavaraki's lab. It was a pleasure to meet the
lab manager, Dr. Kingston, as well as the members of the biology group. At my
first meeeting, I got a better sense for the grad student's projects, including
which project I'll be working on. This project, headed by Romanos,
involves modeling and predicitng how a given peptide will bind to a Major
Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), which is a protein complex core to the immune
system. I spent the rest of the week digging through the code for this project,
learning the ins and outs of the packages and processes being used.
I had an excellent time getting to know the members of the lab, attending meetings,
and exploring Rice's campus. While Texas in the summer is a bit warmer than I'm used to,
it seems like a fun city and I'm excited to spend the next few months here!
