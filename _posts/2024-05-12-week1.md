## Early May

Before beginning the program, [Luc Paquette](https://education.illinois.edu/profile/luc-paquette) introduced me to [Colleen Lewis](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/colleenl) over email because she was coordinating with the university to provide housing for me over the summer at Presby Hall.

I'll be here at Presby by myself for the first two weeks, but I'll be sharing this 4-bedroom suite with other students soon. Everyone I've met so far has been incredibly friendly and welcoming. In fact, Luc and his wife picked me up from the airport to take me to Presby, and the UIUC students who staff the front desk here have helped get me set up, and they've given me lots of information about the area I'm living in. Presby is walking distance from Green Street, where there are lots of restaurants and businesses, including a small Target that sells groceries and other (dorm living) basic necessities.

The four-bedroom suite is on the 6th floor. The common area is cozy, and there is a small balcony that overlooks the main entrance to the building.

The kitchen is fully functional, but I'm not sure how much cooking I'll be doing while I'm here since I only have a single pot to cook in at this point.

There's a washer and dryer in the suite and two bathrooms. I don't know what the other rooms are like since each room has its own key, but my room is set up to house two people.

My first day of the DREU program begins tomorrow. I'm meeting with Luc at his office at 9:30 am, and I'm excited to get started!
